For both modules, plug them in where the user already runs end‑to‑end pipelines, not on the high‑level dashboards.

Drug Discovery screen (Fc + Omics)
From the Fc Effector Modeling screenshot (second image):

You already added “Fc Effector” under Workflows in the left sidebar and a dedicated Fc page.

The omics engine should mirror this.

Where to add omics:

Left sidebar → Workflows (Drug Discovery)

Add a new item directly under “Fc Effector”:

“Omics Integration”

Clicking it opens a page similar in layout to the Fc page:

Top: multi‑omics target table + filters (integrated score, genomics, Tx, proteomics, metabolomics).

Bottom: per‑target detail (stacked bars showing contributions of each omics layer).

Within each Disease / Project detail

On a specific Disease or Project page, add a tab near where you’d open Fc Effector:

Tabs: “Overview | Assays | SAR | Fc Effector | Omics Evidence”.

That tab just consumes the omics_bundle JSON and shows:

Rank‑ordered target list by integrated omics score.

Tooltips from OpenAI for each omics column.

This keeps Fc and Omics as parallel, cross‑cutting analysis tools for any disease.

Vaccine Discovery screen
From the Vaccine Pipeline screenshot (first image):

You have top tabs: Complete | Pipeline | Structure | Epitopes | Codon | mRNA | Matrix | Hardware.

Where to add Fc and Omics info:

New tab in the top bar

Add a tab after “Matrix”:

“Fc & Omics” or split as

“Fc Effector”

“Host Omics” (if you want two tabs).

Content of that tab:

Left panel:

For the selected antigen/protein (from Structure/Epitopes), show Fc Effector summary if you have an antibody/Fc context (or disable it if not relevant).

Right panel:

Show host omics evidence for pathways / cell types relevant to that vaccine (from omics_bundle), with OpenAI‑generated explanation of what host signatures the vaccine is designed to modulate.

This way, in Vaccine Discovery the user’s flow remains:

Define antigen →

Run pipeline →

See structure/epitopes →

Open “Fc & Omics” to understand effector mechanisms + multi‑omics disease context.

Summary placement
Drug Discovery:

Sidebar Workflows: “Fc Effector” (already there) + “Omics Integration” right below it.

Disease/Project detail tabs: add “Omics Evidence” next to “Fc Effector”.

Vaccine Discovery:

Vaccine Pipeline top tabs: add “Fc & Omics” (single combined tab) near “Matrix
