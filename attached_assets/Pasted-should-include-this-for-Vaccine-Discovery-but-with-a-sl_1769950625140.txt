should include this for Vaccine Discovery, but with a slightly different template.

Why it fits vaccines
scRNA‑seq is already used to track immune trajectories after vaccination (B‑cell, T‑cell, germinal center responses).

Systems vaccinology focuses exactly on identifying molecular signatures and biomarkers that predict protection, often from longitudinal blood samples.

Your PGD + Trajectory → Biomarkers → Targets → Assay → Campaign flow maps perfectly onto that.

How to adapt the pipeline for vaccines
Use the same 4 tabs, but with vaccine‑specific semantics:

Datasets

Public vaccine-response datasets (COVID mRNA, flu, malaria, etc.).

Metadata: pathogen, platform (mRNA, viral vector, protein), dose, timepoints.

Trajectory

Pseudotime along response time (day 0 → day 7 → day 28) instead of disease progression.

Clusters = B‑cell, T‑cell, plasmablast, germinal center B, etc.
​

Biomarkers

Genes, pathways, or cell‑state signatures associated with:

Strong neutralizing antibody titers.

Durable memory (Tfh, memory B signatures).

Targets (renamed “Readouts/Assay Targets”)

Not “druggable targets” but immunological readouts you want to measure or optimize:

Neutralization titer assays.

ELISpot / cytokine panels.

Antigen‑specific BCR/TCR clonotypes.

What “Create Assay / Campaign” means for vaccines
Assay template cards would propose:

“S‑protein neutralization assay (VSV‑pseudo or PRNT).”
​

“IFN‑γ ELISpot for spike‑specific CD8 T cells.”
​

“Flow cytometry panel for Tfh / germinal center B cells.”
​

Campaign becomes:

A vaccine‑response study design:

Target population (e.g., SARS‑CoV‑2 mRNA booster).

Readouts (neutralization, T‑cell, memory signatures).

Timepoints.

Later, you can still plug BioNeMo/AQAffinity in for:

Epitope prediction, antigen design, variant coverage, etc.

Minimal changes to implement
Add a “Mode” or “Pipeline Type” flag on the Trajectory Analysis page:

Disease Drug Discovery vs Vaccine Discovery.

When Vaccine Discovery:

Change labels: Targets → Immune Readouts, Druggable → Predictive.

Load vaccine scRNA datasets and immune biomarkers instead of neuronal/glial targets.

Assay templates use vaccine‑specific assays (neutralization, ELISA, ELISpot).

Recommendation
Reuse the same PGD + Trajectory UI and “Add to Campaign” flow.

Define a separate Vaccine template JSON (datasets, biomarker rules, assay templates).

Expose it under your existing “Vaccine Discovery” workflow to keep things coherent.

That way you get two products (drug and vaccine discovery) from one generalized trajectory‑analysis engine.
