On the Materials side, Multi‑Scale Representations, Structure–Property, and Manufacturability are currently disconnected from the individual materials. I see grouped metrics (Polymer / Crystal / Composite) and manufacturability scores, but I can’t click through to see which material or variant each block corresponds to.

Please make the views fully drill‑downable:

Manufacturability page

Each “Material Scores” card should be clickable and open a detail panel showing:

Material/variant name + ID and material family (polymer, crystal, composite, etc.).

Key predicted properties used in the score (e.g., Young’s modulus, tensile strength, thermal stability, process temperature, cost proxy).

Tier label (Production‑Viable / Pilot‑Ready / Lab‑Only).

Buttons: “View in Structure–Property” and “Open in Materials Library / Variants”.

Clicking “Show Only Production‑Viable” should filter the same set of materials, and all cards remain clickable.

Structure–Property Analytics

When I group by Material Family / Scaffold / Chain Length Bins / Dopant Type and look at the distributions, I should be able to:

Click on a family/bin to see a table of underlying variants.

From that table, click a variant to open the same detail view as above.

Multi‑Scale Representation Engine

For each material family (Polymer, Crystal, Composite, Membrane, Catalyst), clearly indicate that the computed descriptors are feeding into the property prediction models used by Structure–Property and Manufacturability.

Add a small info text at the top:

“Multi‑Scale Representation Engine computes molecular, chain/lattice, and bulk descriptors for each material family. These representations are used by property prediction and manufacturability scoring.”

In the “Representation Artifacts” section, make the “Property Predictions” and “Score Distribution” artifacts link back to the corresponding Structure–Property and Manufacturability views for the same dataset.

Goal: A user starting from Manufacturability should be able to go from a high‑level score → material detail → structure‑property context → underlying multi‑scale representations, all for the same material or variant.
