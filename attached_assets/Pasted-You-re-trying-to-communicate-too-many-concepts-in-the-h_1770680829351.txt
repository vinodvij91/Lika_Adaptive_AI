You’re trying to communicate too many concepts in the hero at once. Make the landing page do one job: explain what Lika is and give one click per persona. Everything else can move down the page.

1. Simplify the hero message
Current hero line is long and dense. Replace with a tight structure:

Title (one line):

Adaptive AI platform for molecular R&D

Sub‑title (two lines max):

Design and rank drugs, vaccines, and advanced materials using simulation‑in‑the‑loop AI, BioNeMo, and multi‑omics integration.

This already implies breadth without listing every technique (quantum, Fc, etc.).

2. Compress the domain list
Instead of “Drug Discovery + Vaccine Discovery + Materials Science” twice:

Keep it once, as a secondary line under the subtitle:

Modules for drug discovery, vaccine design, and materials science.

Use three buttons exactly as you have, but visually lighter:

Drug Discovery

Vaccine Discovery

Materials Science

No extra text on the buttons; details belong lower.

3. Move technical stack to a “How it works” band
The phrase:

“Generative design, simulation‑in‑the‑loop, BioNeMo + Molecular ML + Quantum pipelines … Powered by Fc Effector modeling and multi‑omics integration.”

is great content, just not for the hero. Move it into a section below:

Section header: “How Lika works”
Bullets or small cards:

Generative design & virtual screening

BioNeMo‑powered structure and sequence models

Fc effector and multi‑omics engines

Quantum & materials optimization

This keeps the hero clean while still showing depth for people who scroll.

4. Tidy the metrics row
You already have:

1.7M+ SMILES

500K+ materials

750+ disease targets

94.7% model accuracy

Make this a single compact strip with short labels:

| 1.7M+ molecules | 500K+ materials | 750+ disease targets | 94.7% model AUC* |

Use a small footnote (“*example benchmark”) if needed, and drop extra wording.

5. Optional: add one persona‑driven line
Right under the buttons, a single sentence for buyers:
