On this page, “Harvest Fresh” should trigger a full re‑query of external assay databases for the disease/target you’ve selected, then render a ranked table of recommended assays that you can add into campaigns.

Given your UI, the intended flow is:

1. Select context (top-right dropdown)
That dropdown is where you pick what to harvest for:

Disease area (e.g. “Alzheimer’s disease”, “Nipah virus”, “Rheumatoid arthritis”), or

A specific target list associated with that disease (e.g. NLRP3, TFEB, APOE, APP for AD).

Once something is chosen, the center text should change from:

“Select a disease to view recommended assays”

to something like:

“Press Harvest Fresh to pull assays for Alzheimer’s disease (4 targets).”

2. Click “Harvest Fresh”
When you click Harvest Fresh, the backend should:

Take the selected disease/target set.

Call your assay sources (at least mocked for now):

PubChem BioAssay (AID)

ChEMBL activities

BindingDB, etc.

Filter and score assays for relevance:

Match to your targets.

Prefer binding / functional assays with IC50, EC50, Kd, etc.

Rank by quality + recency + diversity.

During this, the page should show a loader:

“Harvesting assays from PubChem and ChEMBL…”

3. Show a “recommended assays” list
After the call returns, the big empty area should populate with a table or cards, e.g.:

Assay	Source	Target	Type	Readout	#Cmpds	Score	Action
AID 123456	PubChem	NLRP3	Biochem	IC50	1,247	0.93	[Details] [Add to Campaign]
CHEMBL98765	ChEMBL	TFEB	Cell	EC50	382	0.88	[Details] [Add to Campaign]
Score = your relevance score for that disease/target.

Clicking Details opens assay metadata, distribution of potencies, link out.

Clicking Add to Campaign pushes it into the selected Campaign’s “Assays” tab.

If you’ve wired nothing yet, “Harvest Fresh” currently does nothing; this is the behavior you want to ask Replit to implement.

4. “Harvest Fresh” vs cached
Conceptually:

Initial page load can show cached recommendations (“Last harvested on…”).

Harvest Fresh forces a new pull from external sources (e.g. to capture new PubChem / ChEMBL assays) and updates the cache.
