Vaccine Discovery UI & Pipeline
Please complete and wire up the Vaccine Discovery domain so it mirrors the quality and depth of the Drug Discovery and Materials Science domains.

1) Vaccine Dashboard
On the Vaccine Discovery dashboard, keep the existing hero card but make the KPI tiles live:

Targets Analyzed = count of protein targets in the Vaccine domain.

Epitopes Identified = total predicted epitopes across all targets.

Vaccine Constructs = count of constructs generated (peptide/mRNA/protein).

Pipelines Run = number of vaccine campaigns executed.

In the “Get Started” row, wire the cards as entry points:

Add Targets → opens the Targets page.

Run Pipeline → opens Vaccine Pipeline with a new campaign wizard.

Trajectory Analysis → opens Trajectory Analysis in Vaccine domain (for scRNA/immune data).

2) Sidebar structure (Vaccine domain)
Ensure the Vaccine sidebar has the following items, each wired:

Dashboard

Import (for protein FASTA, CSV, or project import)

Targets

Vaccine Pipeline

Trajectory Analysis

3D Viewer

BioNeMo AI

Reports

3) Targets page
Implement a Targets page listing vaccine antigens:

Columns: Name, Pathogen/disease, UniProt ID, PDB ID(s), length, status (Imported / From template).

Actions:

“Import Targets” (FASTA upload or manual entry).

“Add from templates” (e.g., Nipah F, SARS‑CoV‑2 Spike, Influenza HA, RSV F, HIV Env, Ebola GP).

“Send to Pipeline” → creates/updates a Vaccine Pipeline campaign with these targets selected.

4) Vaccine Pipeline – campaign view
For each vaccine campaign, create a tabbed layout similar to Drug Discovery campaigns:

Tabs:

Targets

Epitope Design

Constructs

Trajectory & Readouts

Immunogenicity & Safety

Overview

4.1 Targets tab
Show selected targets with metadata (UniProt, PDB, domains, glycosylation sites if available).

Actions:

“Run Epitope Prediction” → moves to Epitope Design tab and triggers prediction.

4.2 Epitope Design tab
Table of predicted epitopes per target.

Columns: Epitope sequence, Start/End, HLA class (I/II), predicted affinity/percentile, conservancy, surface exposure flag.

Filters: by target, class, percentile threshold, length.

Actions:

“Add to Construct” (multi‑select epitopes).

4.3 Constructs tab
List of vaccine constructs (peptide, mRNA, protein).

Fields: Construct name, type, length, number of epitopes, predicted HLA coverage, link to 3D model if available.

Actions:

“Generate Construct” from selected epitopes (simple concatenation with linkers for now).

“Send to BioNeMo” → queue constructs for immunogenicity/safety prediction.

4.4 Trajectory & Readouts tab
If a campaign has associated scRNA/immune datasets, show:

Trajectory map(s) (link/embedded from existing Trajectory Analysis component).

Gene–readout correlation cards: e.g., IGHG1/IGHG3 vs neutralizing titers, ELISpot, etc.

Provide an action “Harvest Immune Assays” (similar to Assay Harvesting) for vaccine‑relevant functional assays if mock data is available.

4.5 Immunogenicity & Safety tab
For each construct, display BioNeMo (or mock) predictions:

Immunogenicity score (0–1)

Predicted T‑cell / B‑cell balance

Cross‑reactivity risk (e.g., host similarity score)

Safety flags (e.g., cytokine storm risk proxy)

Show a matrix/table: constructs vs key metrics, with sortable columns.

Add per‑construct actions: “Mark as Preclinical Candidate”, “Export”.

4.6 Overview tab
A simple stepper like the Drug campaign header:

Select Targets

Design Epitopes

Build Constructs

Predict Immunogenicity

Plan Assays / Experiments

Include a small summary:

X targets, Y epitopes, Z constructs, N candidates selected.

5) Wiring and data
Use mock data where real APIs are not wired yet, but make sure every button and tab actually shows something (no empty states after actions).

Reuse existing components where possible (Trajectory Analysis, 3D Viewer, campaign header).

Goal: Vaccine Discovery should feel like a complete, navigable pipeline from targets → epitopes → constructs → predictions, with a similar UX depth to Drug Discovery.
