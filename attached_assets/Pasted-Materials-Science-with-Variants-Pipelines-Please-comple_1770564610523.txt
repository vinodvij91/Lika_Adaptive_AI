Materials Science with Variants & Pipelines
Please complete and wire up the Materials Science domain so that materials, variants, property prediction, and manufacturability form a coherent pipeline, similar to Drug Discovery campaigns.

1) Materials Dashboard
Make the existing cards live:

Variants Evaluated = total number of material variants with predictions.

Properties Predicted = total number of property predictions run.

Manufacturable = count of variants marked manufacturable (above a threshold).

Active Pipelines = count of materials campaigns/pipelines.

In the “Get Started” row:

Import Materials → Materials Library (import dialog).

Property Pipeline → opens a Materials Pipeline/campaign wizard.

Manufacturability → opens the Manufacturability view filtered to all materials.

2) Sidebar structure (Materials domain)
Ensure the Materials sidebar has these sections:

Dashboard

Import

Materials Library

Variants

Multi‑Scale Representation (if used)

Property Prediction

Structure–Property

Manufacturability

3D Viewer

FEA Simulations (if used)

Simulation Runs

Reports

3) Materials Library
Implement a Materials Library table:

Columns: Name, Category (polymer/biomaterial/crystal), key base properties (e.g., Tg, tensile strength, dielectric constant, PFAS‑free flag), tags (PFAS replacement, spider silk, textile, etc.).

Provide seed entries (mock data OK):

Polymers: PTFE, PVDF, PEEK, PPS, Nylon‑6, PMMA, etc.

Biomaterials: Spider silk MaSp1_WT, MaSp2_WT.

Actions on each row:

“View Details”

“Generate Variants” → opens the Variants page pre‑filtered to this base material.

4) Variants page
For a selected base material, implement:

Controls to set variant strategy:

Polymers: chain length changes, co‑polymer ratio changes, functional group swaps (e.g., CF3→OH, ester→amide).

Biomaterials (spider silk): sequence mutations, repeat block expansions, conservative substitutions.

Inputs: Number of variants, property focus (mechanical/thermal/electrical/environmental).

On “Generate Variants”:

Create a list of variant records (mock generation is fine):

Variant ID

Description of modification

Link back to base material

Table of variants with actions:

“Send to Property Pipeline” (multi‑select).

5) Property Prediction
Implement the Property Prediction page to consume materials and variants:

Inputs: selected base materials and/or variants.

Properties to predict:

Mechanical: tensile strength, Young’s modulus, elongation at break.

Thermal: Tg, Tm, thermal stability.

Electrical: dielectric constant, resistivity.

Surface/environmental: friction coefficient, contact angle, PFAS‑free, biodegradability.

Output:

Table: variant/base × properties.

Ability to filter by application template (PFAS replacement, spider silk fiber, battery material, textile coating).

Provide a simple visualization similar to Multi‑Target radar (axes = properties) for a selected variant or average of all variants.

6) Structure–Property
Reuse the radar/matrix concept: show how property profiles differ between variants and base materials.

Allow selection of: “Original material”, “Best variant for mechanical”, “Best variant for environmental”, etc.

7) Manufacturability
Implement a Manufacturability view where each material/variant gets:

Manufacturability score (0–1 or 0–100) based on mock rules (e.g., processing temperature, solubility, PFAS status, stability).

Key factors:

Process temp window (acceptable vs too high).

Need for exotic solvents.

Regulatory flags (PFAS usage, recyclability).

Table + detail panel:

“Prototype ready”, “Lab only”, or “Not feasible” label.

8) Materials Pipelines / Campaigns
Add a simple Materials Pipeline concept (parallel to Drug Discovery campaigns):

When a user starts a Property Pipeline from the dashboard or Variants page, create a Materials campaign with steps like:

Select base materials

Generate variants

Predict properties

Assess manufacturability

Show an Overview header for each materials campaign similar to the drug campaigns (stepper + status).

In the campaign view, include:

A “Variants” tab (variants included in the campaign).

A “Properties” tab (predictions).

A “Manufacturability” tab (scores and decisions).

9) Data wiring
It’s fine to start with static/mock JSON for materials and variants, but every major button should trigger a visible change (new rows, updated metrics).

Use the same design language as the drug campaigns to keep UX consistent.

Goal: Materials Science should support a full path from base materials → variants → property prediction → manufacturability decisions, with Variants clearly integrated into the workflow.
