Materials Science + PFAS Replacement with OpenFold3 & BioNeMo
TASK: Extend the existing Lika Sciences platform to a full Materials Science mode, integrating OpenFold3 (AlphaFold3‑class) structure prediction and BioNeMo models.
Focus on PFAS replacement plus other application templates (battery, photovoltaic, superconductors, catalysts, thermoelectrics, etc.) as seen in the Pipeline Launcher screenshots.

2. Materials Library & Representation
Implement a Materials Library analogous to Molecules Library:

Data model (Material):

ts
Material {
  id: string
  name: string              // e.g. "PTFE", "PEEK", "Spider Silk MaSp1"
  category: "polymer" | "ceramic" | "metal" | "biomaterial"
  smiles?: string           // for polymer repeat unit or additive
  monomer_smiles?: string
  composition?: string      // e.g. "C2F4", "CaTiO3"
  structure_file?: string   // CIF/PDB path or ID
  properties: {
    density_g_cm3?: number
    tensile_strength_MPa?: number
    elastic_modulus_GPa?: number
    thermal_conductivity_W_mK?: number
    decomposition_temp_C?: number
    dielectric_constant?: number
    surface_energy_mJ_m2?: number
    water_contact_angle_deg?: number
    permeability_O2_Barrer?: number
    pfos_free?: boolean
    pfoa_free?: boolean
  }
  tags: string[]            // "PFAS", "PFAS replacement", "battery", etc.
  source_refs?: string[]
}
Create initial seed materials from earlier PFAS work:

PTFE, PVDF, ETFE, ECTFE, POM, PDMS, PE, UHMWPE, PPS, PEEK, PAEK, PES, PSU, Polyimide, etc.

Store these in materials_seed.json and load at startup.

3. Applications in Pipeline Launcher (Materials Science)
In the Pipeline Launcher (Materials Science mode), extend the Job Type dropdown Molecular Docking with an Applications tree, as seen in your screenshots.

Under Materials Science show:

Battery Materials

Photovoltaic Materials

Superconductor Discovery

Catalyst Discovery

Thermoelectric Materials

PFAS Replacement (highlight this)

Aerospace Materials

Biomedical Materials

Wide‑Gap Semiconductors

Sustainable Construction

Transparent Conductors

Rare‑Earth‑Free Magnets

Solid Electrolytes

Water Purification

Carbon Capture

Selecting an application should:

Pre‑configure compute parameters (grid size, chunk size, workers).

Load a template pipeline spec (materials, properties, models).

Example config (materials_applications.json):

json
{
  "pfas_replacement": {
    "name": "PFAS Replacement",
    "description": "Screen PFAS-free polymers and additives for PTFE/PVDF replacements.",
    "default_chunk_size": 10000,
    "default_workers": 4,
    "default_properties": ["dielectric_constant", "thermal_stability_C", "chemical_resistance_index", "friction_coefficient"],
    "default_model": "bionemo-materials-property-v1"
  },
  "battery_materials": {
    "name": "Battery Materials",
    "description": "Screen cathode/electrolyte materials for high ionic conductivity and stability.",
    "default_properties": ["ionic_conductivity_S_cm", "band_gap_eV"]
  }
}
In the Launch Pipeline tab:

When user selects “PFAS Replacement”, show description and pre‑fill properties and models.

4. OpenFold3 (AlphaFold‑class) Integration for Biomaterials
For biomaterials (spider silk, enzymes, protein‑polymer interfaces):

Deploy OpenFold3 NIM (already handled by infra team).

Add a backend API:

python
# /api/materials/openfold3_complex
POST body:
{
  "material_id": "PTFE_replacement_01",
  "protein_sequence": "MTEYKLVVVGAGGVGKSALTIQLI...",
  "ligand_smiles": "C([C@@H]1[C@H](...)",  # cellulose or polymer repeat
  "context": "protein-material interface for textile fiber"
}
The handler will:

Call OpenFold3 NIM /v1/predict with molecules = [{type: "protein", sequence}, {type: "ligand", smiles}].

Store resulting cif/pdb in structures/.

Attach structure_id to the Material or Variant.

In 3D Viewer:

Allow loading protein–polymer complexes from these predictions.

Use same 3D component as drug docking.

5. BioNeMo Property Prediction for Materials
Add a BioNeMo AI section under Materials Science that exposes:

bionemo-materials-property-v1 (conceptual name)

Input: Material SMILES/composition + optional structure descriptors.

Output: Predicted properties: dielectric constant, band gap, elastic modulus, etc.

Backend endpoint:

python
# /api/materials/predict_properties
POST {
  "material_ids": ["PTFE", "PEEK", "UHMWPE"],
  "properties": ["dielectric_constant", "friction_coefficient", "thermal_stability_C"]
}
This calls BioNeMo and stores predictions linked to each Material.

Use these predictions in:

Property Prediction workflow

Pipeline Launcher results

6. PFAS Replacement Pipeline (Detailed)
Create a PFAS Replacement pipeline template that reuses your existing high‑throughput screening infrastructure:

Input:

Library of candidate PFAS‑free polymers/additives (SMILES, property priors).

Target use cases: gaskets, seals, coatings (temp, pressure, chemical environment).

Pipeline stages:

Filter stage (fast rules):

Remove PFAS/PFOS/PFOA‑like patterns (perfluorinated chains).

Enforce sustainability tags (e.g., GRS/BCI/GOTS compatibility if biomass‑derived).

Property prediction (BioNeMo):

Predict:

Thermal stability Td_C

Chemical resistance index

Friction coefficient / wear rate

Dielectric constant

Process temperature window (melt/softening).

Structure prediction (OpenFold3, optional):

For biopolymer candidates (protein‑based coatings, silk‑like fibers):

Predict structure + interaction with substrate (e.g., steel, cellulose) using OpenFold3.

Ranking + selection:

Multi‑objective ranking: maximize stability + chemical resistance, minimize cost/environmental impact.

Campaign export:

Export top candidates with predicted properties, structures, and recommended experimental tests.

UI in Pipeline Launcher:

When “PFAS Replacement” selected:

Show short explanation:
“Screen PFAS‑free polymers and biomaterials as replacements for PTFE/PVDF in seals, coatings and textiles.”

Fields:

Application context: dropdown (seals, gaskets, coatings, textiles).

Max temperature, pressure, media (acid, solvent, water) → used to set thresholds.

7. Results & Reports
Extend Results tab in Pipeline Launcher to handle materials:

For each run:

Show application (PFAS Replacement, Battery Materials, etc.).

Show library size, models used (BioNeMo, OpenFold3).

Allow drill‑down:

Table: Material ID, predicted properties, scores, and structure icon if OpenFold3 was used.

Ability to export:

CSV/JSON property tables.

SDF for polymer/additive molecules.

PDB/CIF for biomaterial structures.

8. Reuse from Drug Discovery
Reuse as much existing infra as possible:

Compute Nodes & Dask: same chunking & worker controls.

Job Queue: materials jobs are just another job type.

3D Viewer & Docking engine: same code, but for protein–polymer instead of protein–drug.

Reporting: mirror SAR reports but for structure–property analyses.

9. Acceptance Criteria
Materials mode visible with all sidebar items.

Pipeline Launcher shows Materials Science applications, including PFAS Replacement.

User can:

Import a materials library (CSV/SMILES).

Launch a PFAS Replacement pipeline:

Runs BioNeMo property prediction.

Optionally calls OpenFold3 for biomaterials.

View results and 3D structures.

OpenFold3 and BioNeMo are both usable from Materials workflows (via backend APIs).

No changes break existing Drug Discovery workflows.

Please implement this step‑by‑step, prioritizing:

PFAS Replacement application in Pipeline Launcher.

Materials Library + property prediction via BioNeMo.

OpenFold3 integration for biomaterials (protein–polymer complexes).
